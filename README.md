# Automated-Testing-with Robot Famework part 1

**Along this project I gathered the following knowledge:**


Install & configure the Robot Framework test automation tool plus libraries like Selenium, API, database, and more

Create & run your first Robot Framework test automation script (Selenium Webdriver example)

Understand the basics of many Robot Framework test automation libraries (Selenium Webdriver, API, Database, XML, Files, etc.)

Use the page object pattern to create more reusable, easier to interpret test automation scripts

Run/execute Robot Framework automated tests in many different ways, including from a command window, batch files, Jenkins, and Windows task scheduler

Create user defined keywords to express your tests in business domain terms instead of cryptic Selenium Webdriver code
